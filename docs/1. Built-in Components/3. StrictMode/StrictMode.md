# StrictMode

StrictMode lets you `find common bugs` in your components `early during development`

```
  root.render(
    <StrictMode>
      <App />
    </StrictMode>
  );
```

## # Usage

- Enabling Strict Mode for `entire app`
- Enabling strict mode for `a part of the app`
- `Fixing bugs` found by `double rendering` in development
- `Fixing bugs` found by `re-running Effects` in development
- `Fixing deprecation warnings` enabled by Strict Mode
